    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 24 December 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how SunFlex (“SunFlex”, “we”, “us”, or “the App”)
      collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the SunFlex application.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose of the App</h2>
    <p>
      SunFlex is a companion guidance application designed to provide general,
      informational recommendations related to sun exposure. The App uses environmental
      information, such as UV index data, to assist users in making informed decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The App is provided for informational and educational purposes only and is not
      intended to provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
    </p>

    <h2>Not Medical Advice</h2>
    <p>
      SunFlex does not provide medical advice and should not be relied upon as a
      substitute for professional medical guidance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Information presented in the App is general in nature and may not be appropriate
      for all individuals. Always seek advice from a qualified healthcare professional
      regarding any medical or skin-related concerns.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      SunFlex collects only the information necessary to provide core functionality.
      This may include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Approximate location data to display relevant UV index information</li>
      <li>Basic usage data to improve app performance and reliability</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      SunFlex does not require users to create an account and does not collect
      personally identifiable information such as names, physical addresses, or
      payment details unless explicitly provided by the user.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>
      Information collected by the App is used solely to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Provide and improve app features</li>
      <li>Display relevant environmental information</li>
      <li>Maintain app stability and functionality</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      SunFlex does not sell, rent, or trade personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>User Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      You acknowledge that sun exposure involves inherent risks and that individual
      skin response varies.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are solely responsible for how you interpret and act on information provided
      by the App, including decisions related to sun exposure duration, timing, and
      protective measures such as sunscreen or clothing.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable measures to protect information collected through the App.
      However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is completely secure,
      and absolute security cannot be guaranteed.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App may rely on third-party services (such as weather or UV data providers)
      to deliver information. These services operate independently and are governed
      by their own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted
      on this page. Continued use of the App after changes are published constitutes
      acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>
