    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>

    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 24 December 2025</p>

    <p>
      These Terms of Use govern your access to and use of the SunFlex application
      (“SunFlex”, “we”, “us”, or “the App”). By accessing or using the App, you agree
      to be bound by these Terms of Use. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose of the App</h2>
    <p>
      SunFlex is a companion guidance application intended to provide general,
      informational recommendations related to sun exposure. The App uses environmental
      information, such as UV index data, to assist users in making informed decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The App is provided for informational and educational purposes only.
    </p>

    <h2>Not Medical Advice</h2>
    <p>
      SunFlex does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Information presented in the App is general in nature and should not be considered
      a substitute for professional medical advice. Always consult a qualified healthcare
      professional regarding any medical or skin-related concerns.
    </p>

    <h2>User Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      You acknowledge that sun exposure involves inherent risks and that individual skin
      response varies.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are solely responsible for how you interpret and act on information provided
      by the App, including decisions related to sun exposure duration, timing, and
      protective measures such as sunscreen or clothing.
    </p>

    <h2>Assumption of Risk</h2>
    <p>
      By using the App, you acknowledge and accept that sun exposure carries inherent
      risks, including but not limited to sunburn, skin damage, and long-term health
      effects.
    </p>

    <p>
      Use of the App is entirely at your own discretion and risk.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, SunFlex and its operators shall not be
      liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages
      arising out of or related to your use of, or inability to use, the App.
    </p>

    <p>
      SunFlex does not guarantee any specific outcomes related to tanning, sun exposure,
      or skin health.
    </p>

    <h2>Availability and Changes</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the App (or any part of it)
      at any time, with or without notice.
    </p>

    <p>
      These Terms of Use may be updated periodically. Continued use of the App after changes
      are published constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with applicable laws,
      without regard to conflict of law principles.
